# Decentralized Escrow Application

This is an Escrow Dapp built with Hardhat. An Escrow is a contractual arrangement in which a third party receives and distribuses money or propriety for the primary transacting parties, with the disbursement dependent on conditions agreed to by the transacting parties.

## Project Layout

There are three top-level folders:

1. `/app` - contains the front-end application
2. `/contracts` - contains the solidity contract
3. `/tests` - contains tests for the solidity contract
